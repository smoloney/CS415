quick sort
      recurively sort both sides of pivot
quick select
      compare to K

worst-case complexity of quick-select
	   k = n and we pick smallest remaining element as the pivot
	   N(N-1) / 2 = theta (n^2)

balanced split case
	 in this cas, we assume that the pivot has rank (current size of array) / 2 at each step
	    2n

average case
	assume that the pivot is chosen to be any of the keys in the current segment w/ uniform probability
	call a pivot good is its rank lies between n/3 and 3n/4 where n = size of current block


polynomials
	p1(x) = 2 + 3x+x^2+x^3
	p2(x) = 3 + 4x + 2x^2 - x^3

	= 6 + 17x + 19x^2+12x^3+

	i-th coefficient of product requires theta (i) integer muliplilcations
	     total # of integer mult = theta (n^2)

	standard representation of a polynomaial is as a vector of coeffiecents
	eg
	1-x+3x3 -> 1, -1, 0, 3
	alternative representation:
		    pick a set of 4 x-values (any 4 distinct values would be fine)
		    x 0 1 -1 2
		    y 1 3 -1 23  point value representation
